cmhtools depends on the presence of an environment variable, CMHTOOLS, whose
value is the location of the toplevel directory of cmhtools.  It needs this
environment to find the libraries.  If the cmhtools is in your home directory,
the following will work:
in bash or sh:  > export CMHTOOLS=~/cmhtools
in csh or tcsh: > setenv CMHTOOLS ~/cmhtools
