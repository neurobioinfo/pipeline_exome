Rolling back to GATK 3.6 due to problems with tmp files in Genotyper
>2017-09-13
Updated most of the tools versions, prior to deployment to graham :
fastqc 0.11.5
GATK 3.8
Java JRE 1.8.0_45
picard lib 2.12.0
trimmomatic 0.36
bwa 0.7.16a
samtools 1.3.1


>2013-02-18
modified function.library's picard functions to all haveVALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT
added export PERL5LIB=$PIPELINE_HOME/soft/packages/cmhtools/lib,so smp-runner can work on other systems
added $ACCOUNT variable to wgs.bam.scatter (defaults toish-284-ab) for all qsub/msub submissions; added -a option to launch script
added -1 and -2 to getopt portion of wgs.bam.scatter (it was accidentally omitted and has never come up)
added fix for scinet gpc, which has msub present but diabled, thereby screwing up the test that defines QUEUE for all script launches in wgs.bam.scatter
added patch for scinet gpc to wgs script 1_3, which forces $THREADS=1 (if [[ `uname -n` =~ ^gpc ]]); otherwise this step exceeds gpc node memory limit
added $UNCOMPRESSED=1 to wgs.bam.scatter, and added $UNCOMPRESSED to sample_merge_fastq call in 1_1 and 1_2 (b/c SamToFastq outputfrom 0_1 is uncompressed, and $UNCOMPRESSED is not sent to 1_1 and 1_2 by wgs.bam.scatter)
added export CMHTOOLS=$PIPELINE_HOME/soft/packages/ toinit_pipeline.sh (so that smp-runner won't fail on non-rqchp machines)
replaced CN string in @RG tag in 1_3 with CN:Illumina (it wasCN:BGI by default). Ultimately will have to add options in launch script to specify sequencer and sequencing centre (now hardcoded as Illumina for both)
modified genome.aligned_bam.scala to make case class cov members compatible with GATK1.6 (commented old lines)
modified several things pertaining to ENC33 variable in wgs.bam.scatter: wgs.bam.scatter flag is now -I (doc updated w/details); function.library now uses ENC64 for clarity; also reflected in 0_1,1_1 and 1_2
removed line(s) with "--memory_limit_threshold" from function.library (specific to GATKv2's Queue.jar)
added -Xmx"$JAVA_MEM"g to function.library's alignment post-processing function (a bunch of genomes died in class cov for lack of memory)
removed post-recal cov step from genome.aligned-bam.scala, because it takes a lot of time and we don't use the outputs!!
added this.nt = qscript.ppn back to cas class cov; Alex removed it for GATK2 and as a result the run was exploding walltime
replaced ContextCovariate with DinucCovariate in class cov
replaced class recal with the same class from an earlier script (the one I removed was made for GATKv2)
remove the "XXX_" from the sample_genome_variant_calling function in function.library
created changelog file in svn rep, containing the above text

>2013-02-19
overhauled wgs.bam.scatter's handling of input arguments to match the style used in exome launch script
added EXTRA_CONF config file utility to wgs.bam.scatter
added CENTER, VERBOSE and SFS options to wgs.bam.scatter
fixed minor bug in wgs.bam.scatter's handling of ".done" files
created EXTRA_CONF files for illumina with server-specific values for briaree, cottos, colosse, guillimin, scinet (in ./data/templates)
removed hardcoded "CN:Illumina" from 1_3 and replaced with new variable $CENTER
added verbose outputs to all wgs.bam-specific functions in function.library
added echo VERBOSE and SFS status to all wgs scatter scripts; made command echo dependent on VERBOSE=1
added internal SFS and fail-point checks (.done files) to all wgs.scatter scripts with >1 library function (all except 0_1)...3_1 fail-checking is especially impressive
cleaned up extraneous comments at the end of all wgs.scatter scripts
server specific configs (with the -x option)
verbosity level in the function library (with the -v option)
added compileMappingStats.pl to the bin folder
cleaned unused function in function.library

>2013-02-27
tiny change to scala from wgs.genome.bam pipeline: @Input var key: short name changed to "key" and not "k", to comply with sample_metrics_DepthOfCoverage call in function.library
tiny change to function.library: DepthOfCoverage function no longer says it's launching capture-chip interval-based stats, but just "stats" (since genomes do no chip-based DofC)
added GenomeAnalysisTK-2.2-16-g9f648cb folder to $PIPELINE_HOME/soft/packages (GATKv2.2 for UnifiedGenotyper runs
added export GATK2_DIR to init.pipeline.sh, to point to folder above
changed $GATK_DIR to $GATK2_DIR in function.library sample_genome_variant_calling (to use GATKv2.2); also removed "/dist" from java -jar command for -T UnifiedGenotyper in same function
generate md5 for raw reads
minor bugfixes for exome pipeline

>2013-03-25
minor change to wgs.genome.bam 3_1: removed hardcoded run names in job checkpointing; replaced with generic loop over keys of the "process" hash ("for run in ${!process[@]}; do ...")
